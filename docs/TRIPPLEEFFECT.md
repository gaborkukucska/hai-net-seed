# TrippleEffect Framework: A Technical Explanation

## 1. Introduction

The TrippleEffect framework is an asynchronous, multi-agent system designed for collaborative task execution. Built on Python's `asyncio`, it facilitates complex workflows through a collection of specialized, state-driven AI agents. The architecture is centered around a main orchestrator, the `AgentManager`, which manages the lifecycle, communication, and execution of all agents within a session.

Agents operate in a semi-autonomous manner, driven by a state machine and interacting with their environment and each other through a structured tool-based system. Communication is primarily handled via an event-driven mechanism, where agents yield events (such as tool requests or state change proposals) that are processed by the framework's core handlers. This design allows for a clear separation of concerns between the agent's "thinking" process and the execution of actions, enabling robust error handling, workflow management, and observability.

The framework's core philosophy is to provide a structured yet flexible environment for agent collaboration, where high-level objectives are broken down and delegated through a hierarchy of specialized agents, from project management to individual task execution.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1. The `AgentManager`: Central Orchestrator

The `AgentManager` is the singleton heart of the framework. It is instantiated once at application startup and holds the master state of the entire system. Its primary responsibilities include:

- **Agent Lifecycle Management**: Instantiating, deleting, and tracking all `Agent` objects. It holds the definitive dictionary of all active agents.
- **Session and State Management**: Managing the current project and session context, including database interactions for persistence and logging. It orchestrates the saving and loading of sessions.
- **Input Handling**: Acting as the primary entry point for user input, receiving messages and delegating them to the appropriate agent (typically the Admin AI).
- **Scheduling**: Initiating agent execution cycles by placing `AgentCycleHandler.run_cycle` tasks onto the `asyncio` event loop.
- **Component Hub**: Serving as a central service locator, providing agents with access to other core components like the `ToolExecutor`, `WorkflowManager`, and various handlers.

### 2.2. The `Agent`: A State-Driven Entity

The `Agent` class (`src/agents/core.py`) represents a single, independent actor within the framework. It is not just a conversational entity; it is a state-driven worker with a defined lifecycle and capabilities.

- **State Machine**: Each agent's behavior is dictated by its `agent_type` (e.g., `Admin`, `PM`, `Worker`) and its current `state` (e.g., `planning`, `work`, `manage`). State transitions are fundamental to the framework's workflow and are either requested by the agent itself or triggered by the `WorkflowManager`.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: The core of an agent's operation is the `process_message` async generator method. This method does not return a single, final response. Instead, it `yield`s a series of events representing its thought process and desired actions.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Agents communicate their intentions by yielding structured dictionary events. Key event types include:
    - `tool_requests`: Indicates the agent wishes to execute one or more tools.
    - `agent_state_change_requested`: A proposal to transition to a new state.
    - `final_response`: A terminal text-based response intended for a user or another agent.
    - `agent_thought`: A meta-cognitive thought process, logged for observability but not part of the primary conversational history.
- **Encapsulation**: Each agent encapsulates its own configuration, message history, and a reference to its LLM provider, allowing for heterogeneous agents (using different models or providers) to coexist within the same session.

### 2.3. Asynchronous, Event-Driven Execution Flow

The framework's execution model is non-blocking and event-driven, orchestrated by the `AgentCycleHandler`. This handler mediates the interaction between an `Agent` and the framework.

1.  **Cycle Initiation**: The `AgentManager` schedules an agent's execution cycle by calling `AgentCycleHandler.run_cycle(agent)`.
2.  **Prompt Assembly**: The `AgentCycleHandler` prepares the necessary data for the LLM call, primarily by assembling the agent's current message history and injecting relevant system prompts or context.
3.  **Event Generation**: The handler calls the agent's `process_message` method, which begins yielding events.
4.  **Event Processing**: The `AgentCycleHandler` consumes events from the `process_message` generator and acts upon them.
    - If a `tool_requests` event is yielded, the handler passes the request to the `InteractionHandler` and `ToolExecutor` to perform the action. The results are then formatted and appended to the agent's message history.
    - If a `agent_state_change_requested` event is yielded, the `WorkflowManager` is invoked to validate and apply the state transition.
    - Other events (`final_response`, `agent_thought`) are logged and broadcast to the UI.
5.  **Cycle Continuation/Completion**: Based on the events processed, the `NextStepScheduler` component determines the agent's subsequent status. The agent might be set to `IDLE` if its turn is complete, or it might be immediately rescheduled for another cycle if the workflow requires it (e.g., after a tool call).

This decoupled, event-yielding architecture is a cornerstone of the TrippleEffect framework, enabling complex, multi-step agent actions and ensuring the system remains responsive.

## 3. The Agent Execution Loop: A Step-by-Step Guide

The agent execution loop is the core process that drives all agent activity. It is managed by the `AgentCycleHandler` and follows a precise, asynchronous sequence. The following steps detail a single, complete execution cycle, from scheduling to completion.

**Pre-condition**: An agent is in the `IDLE` state and an external event (e.g., a user message, a periodic timer, or another agent's action) has triggered the need for it to act.

---

**Step 1: Cycle Scheduling (`AgentManager`)**

- The `AgentManager.schedule_cycle(agent)` method is called.
- This creates an `asyncio.Task` for the `AgentCycleHandler.run_cycle(agent)` coroutine, placing it on the event loop for execution. The agent's status is immediately set to `PROCESSING`.

**Step 2: Context Preparation (`AgentCycleHandler` -> `PromptAssembler`)**

- Inside `run_cycle`, the `PromptAssembler.prepare_llm_call_data` method is invoked.
- It assembles the final list of messages to be sent to the LLM. This involves:
    1.  Retrieving the agent's persistent `message_history`.
    2.  Injecting the appropriate system prompt based on the agent's `type` and current `state` (retrieved from `WorkflowManager`).
    3.  Adding any dynamic context, such as the current time for the Admin AI or a specific task description for a Worker agent.

**Step 3: Event Generation (`Agent` -> `process_message`)**

- The `AgentCycleHandler` calls `agent.process_message()`, which returns an asynchronous generator.
- The `agent.llm_provider.stream_completion()` method is called, which begins streaming the LLM's response.
- As the LLM generates text, the `process_message` method parses it in real-time and `yield`s events. This is the critical step where the agent's raw output is translated into structured, actionable events for the framework.

**Step 4: Event Consumption and Handling (`AgentCycleHandler`)**

- The `AgentCycleHandler` iterates through the events yielded by `agent.process_message`. The handling logic branches based on the `type` of each event:

    - **`type: agent_thought`**: The thought content is logged to the database and broadcast to the UI for observability. Processing continues.

    - **`type: tool_requests`**:
        - The agent's turn is considered to be action-oriented.
        - The `AgentCycleHandler` loops through each tool call in the `calls` list.
        - For each call, it invokes `InteractionHandler.execute_single_tool`, which in turn finds the correct tool in the `ToolExecutor` and executes it.
        - The result from the tool (a dictionary) is formatted into a `role: "tool"` message and appended to the agent's `message_history`.
        - The `NextStepScheduler` is later informed that a tool was executed successfully, which typically results in the agent being immediately re-scheduled for another cycle to process the tool results.

    - **`type: agent_state_change_requested`**:
        - The handler calls `WorkflowManager.change_state(agent, requested_state)`.
        - The `WorkflowManager` validates if the transition is legal for the agent's type and current state.
        - If valid, the agent's `state` attribute is updated, and its status is reset to `IDLE`.
        - The agent is typically re-scheduled to begin work in its new state.

    - **`type: final_response`**:
        - This indicates a terminal text response.
        - The response is first passed to the `ConstitutionalGuardian` for a safety and compliance review.
        - If the review passes, the content is logged, broadcast to the UI, and appended to the agent's history. The agent's status is set to `IDLE`. The cycle is complete.
        - If the review fails, the agent's status is set to `AWAITING_USER_REVIEW_CG`, and the user is prompted for a decision.

    - **`type: error` or `type: malformed_tool_call`**:
        - The cycle is aborted.
        - An error message is constructed and added to the agent's history as a `role: "system"` message to provide context for a retry.
        - The `AgentHealthMonitor` logs the failure. If failure patterns are detected (e.g., repeated empty responses, looping), it may trigger an intervention.
        - The `FailoverHandler` may be invoked to attempt a retry with a different model or provider.

**Step 5: Cycle Outcome and Next Step Scheduling (`AgentCycleHandler` -> `OutcomeDeterminer` & `NextStepScheduler`)**

- After the event loop finishes (either by completion or by being broken by an event), the `OutcomeDeterminer` analyzes the context of the completed cycle (e.g., were there errors? was an action taken?).
- Based on this outcome, the `NextStepScheduler.schedule_next_step` method makes the final decision on the agent's fate:
    - **Re-schedule**: If the agent needs to continue its work (e.g., after a tool call), `AgentManager.schedule_cycle` is called again.
    - **Do Nothing**: If the agent's turn is complete and it should wait for a new trigger, its status is left as `IDLE`.

This structured, multi-component loop ensures that the agent's execution is predictable, observable, and resilient to errors, forming the backbone of the TrippleEffect framework's operational stability.

## 4. Key Components and Handlers

The framework's functionality is modularized into several key components and handlers. Understanding their individual roles is crucial to understanding the system as a whole.

### 4.1. `AgentManager` (`src/agents/manager.py`)

As the central orchestrator, the `AgentManager` is more than just a container for agents. It is an active component that manages the application's core logic.

- **Implementation Details**: It is instantiated as a singleton within the FastAPI application's `lifespan` context. It holds references to all other major handlers (`SessionManager`, `AgentCycleHandler`, `ToolExecutor`, etc.), making it the primary service locator.
- **Key Methods**:
    - `schedule_cycle()`: The entry point for starting an agent's execution.
    - `handle_user_message()`: The ingress point for all user interactions, responsible for queuing messages for the Admin AI.
    - `create_agent_instance()` / `delete_agent_instance()`: Methods that abstract the agent creation/deletion logic (defined in `agent_lifecycle.py`), including database record creation.
    - `save_session()` / `load_session()`: Coordinates with the `SessionManager` to persist and retrieve the entire framework state.
    - `_periodic_pm_manage_check()`: An internal `asyncio` task that periodically checks for Project Manager agents in the `manage` state that need to be activated, forming the basis of the PM's autonomous project oversight.

### 4.2. `Agent` (`src/agents/core.py`)

The `Agent` class is the blueprint for all intelligent actors in the system.

- **Implementation Details**: It is initialized with a configuration dictionary, a reference to an LLM provider instance, and a reference back to the `AgentManager`. Its `message_history` is a simple list of dictionaries, adhering to the standard required by most LLM APIs.
- **Key Attributes**:
    - `agent_id`, `persona`, `agent_type`, `state`: The core identifiers and state machine attributes.
    - `llm_provider`: An instance of a class that inherits from `BaseLLMProvider`, ensuring a consistent interface for making LLM calls.
    - `raw_xml_tool_call_pattern`: A dynamically generated regex pattern, created at initialization based on the available tools in the `ToolExecutor`. This allows the agent to efficiently parse its own output for tool calls.

### 4.3. `AgentCycleHandler` (`src/agents/cycle_handler.py`)

This is the engine that drives the agent execution loop. It is stateless itself, operating purely on the `agent` and `context` it is given for each `run_cycle` call.

- **Implementation Details**: It is composed of several sub-components that handle specific parts of the cycle (`PromptAssembler`, `OutcomeDeterminer`, `NextStepScheduler`, etc.). This compositional design makes the cycle logic easier to manage and extend.
- **Cycle Components**:
    - **`PromptAssembler`**: Responsible for constructing the exact list of messages for the LLM, injecting system prompts and context.
    - **`XMLValidator`**: A utility used to validate and attempt recovery of malformed XML tool calls from an agent's response.
    - **`ContextSummarizer`**: An intelligent component that monitors the token count of an agent's history and, if it exceeds a threshold, uses an LLM to summarize the context, preventing token overflow errors with smaller models.
    - **`AgentHealthMonitor`**: Tracks agent behavior over multiple cycles to detect problematic patterns like loops, empty responses, or repetitive actions, and can trigger recovery plans.
    - **`OutcomeDeterminer` & `NextStepScheduler`**: These work together at the end of the cycle to analyze what happened and decide whether the agent should be set to `IDLE` or be immediately re-scheduled.

### 4.4. `InteractionHandler` & `ToolExecutor` (`src/agents/interaction_handler.py`, `src/tools/executor.py`)

This pair of components manages all agent interactions with the "outside world" via tools.

- **`ToolExecutor`**: A simple but crucial component. It auto-discovers all available tool classes, instantiates them, and stores them in a dictionary keyed by the tool's name. It provides a single `execute_tool` method that takes the tool name and arguments.
- **`InteractionHandler`**: Acts as a mediator between the `AgentCycleHandler` and the `ToolExecutor`. Its `execute_single_tool` method contains the boilerplate logic for calling the executor, handling exceptions, logging the result to the database, and formatting the output into the `role: "tool"` message structure that the agent expects in its history.

### 4.5. `WorkflowManager` (`src/agents/workflow_manager.py`)

The `WorkflowManager` handles high-level, framework-defined processes that are triggered by an agent's output, rather than direct tool calls.

- **Implementation Details**: It uses a dictionary of trigger patterns (e.g., a specific XML tag like `<plan>`) mapped to `Workflow` objects. The `process_agent_output_for_workflow` method checks an agent's response against these triggers.
- **Example Workflow (`project_creation`)**: When the Admin AI outputs a plan enclosed in `<plan>` tags, the `WorkflowManager` intercepts this. The `ProjectCreationWorkflow` is executed, which performs the framework-level actions of creating a project task, creating a new Project Manager agent, and assigning the task to it. This entire process is transparent to the Admin AI, which simply sees its plan being accepted.
- **State Management**: The `WorkflowManager` is also the authority on state transitions. Its `change_state` method contains the logic defining all valid state transitions for each agent type, ensuring the integrity of the state machine.

### 4.6. `ConstitutionalGuardian` & Safety Layers

The framework includes a dedicated safety and reliability layer, embodied by the `ConstitutionalGuardian` (CG) agent and the `AgentHealthMonitor`.

- **`ConstitutionalGuardian`**: A specialized, non-interactive agent (`constitutional_guardian_ai`). Before any `final_response` from another agent is committed, the text is sent to the CG. The CG uses a dedicated system prompt and the principles defined in `governance.yaml` to check for violations. It returns either `<OK/>` or `<CONCERN>...</CONCERN>`. If a concern is raised, the original agent is paused, and user intervention is required.
- **`AgentHealthMonitor`**: As described in the `AgentCycleHandler` section, this component acts as an automated check against common agent failure modes. It is a key part of the framework's resilience, capable of intervening with corrective feedback or forcing an agent into an error state to prevent infinite loops.

## 5. State and Communication Model

The framework's operations are governed by a strict state machine and a well-defined communication model, which together ensure predictable and organized agent behavior.

### 5.1. The Agent State Machine

An agent's behavior, system prompt, and expected output are determined by the combination of its `agent_type` and its current `state`. The `WorkflowManager` enforces valid transitions between these states.

-   **Admin Agent (`admin_ai`) States**:
    -   `conversation`: The default state for interacting with the user, monitoring project updates, and identifying new high-level tasks.
    -   `planning`: A focused state where the agent's sole objective is to produce a detailed, structured plan in response to a user request. The output is expected to be wrapped in `<plan>` tags.

-   **Project Manager (PM) Agent States**:
    -   `startup`: The initial state for a new PM. Its goal is to take the initial plan from the Admin AI and break it down into a list of specific, actionable tasks for worker agents, outputting them in a `<task_list>` XML block.
    -   `build_team_tasks`: A guided state where the PM creates a team and then creates the necessary worker agents one by one. The framework injects system messages to guide the PM through this sequential process.
    -   `activate_workers`: A state where the PM assigns the previously defined tasks to the newly created worker agents.
    -   `manage`: The PM's main operational loop. It periodically activates to monitor task progress, review completed work, and report status back to the Admin AI.
    -   `standby`: A dormant state entered after a project is considered complete.

-   **Worker Agent States**:
    -   `work`: The primary state where the agent executes a specific task it has been assigned.
    -   `wait`: A state where the agent has completed its task and is waiting for the PM to review its work and provide a new task.

### 5.2. Communication Protocols

Communication within the framework is handled through several distinct channels.

-   **User <-> Framework**: All user messages are sent to the `AgentManager.handle_user_message` endpoint. These messages are placed in the Admin AI's message history, and a cycle is scheduled for the Admin AI to process them. This is the primary ingress point for new work.

-   **Agent -> Framework (Event Yielding)**: This is the main internal communication method. As detailed in the Execution Loop section, an agent's `process_message` generator yields events to the `AgentCycleHandler`. This is how an agent signals its intent to do anything other than send a simple text response.

-   **Framework -> Agent (System Messages)**: The framework, primarily through the `AgentCycleHandler` or `WorkflowManager`, can inject messages with `role: "system"` into an agent's history. This is a powerful mechanism used to:
    -   Provide feedback on errors (e.g., malformed tool calls).
    -   Give context for a new state (e.g., "You are now in the 'work' state. Your task is...").
    -   Intervene to break loops (e.g., "You appear to be stuck. Please try a different tool.").

-   **Agent <-> Tools (XML)**: The definitive method for an agent to request a tool execution is by outputting a structured XML block in its response. The framework uses regex (`raw_xml_tool_call_pattern`) to parse these blocks. The format is always:
    ```xml
    <tool_name>
        <action>action_to_perform</action>
        <param1>value1</param1>
        <param2>value2</param2>
    </tool_name>
    ```
    This strict format ensures reliable parsing and execution.

-   **Agent <-> Agent (`SendMessageTool`)**: Agents can communicate directly with one another using the `SendMessageTool`. The tool takes a `target_agent_id` and `message_content` as parameters. When executed, the framework appends the message content to the target agent's message history, prefixed with `[From @sender_agent_id]:`, and schedules a cycle for the target agent if it is idle. This enables sophisticated, hierarchical delegation and reporting.

## 6. Conclusion and Intended Potential

The TrippleEffect framework is a robust system designed for building sophisticated multi-agent applications. Its core strengths lie in its asynchronous nature, its clear separation of concerns between agent logic and framework orchestration, and its resilient, state-driven execution model.

The intended potential of this architecture is to enable the creation of highly specialized agent teams that can tackle complex, long-running tasks with minimal human intervention. The hierarchical structure (Admin -> PM -> Workers) allows for a natural decomposition of problems. By leveraging the state machine, agents can be guided through complex workflows, ensuring that tasks like project planning, team building, task assignment, and execution occur in a reliable and predictable order.

An AI or developer using this documentation as a guide should be able to replicate the key architectural patterns: the central `AgentManager`, the event-yielding `Agent` core, the `AgentCycleHandler` as the execution engine, and the use of distinct handlers for tools, workflows, and state management. This modular design is the key to the framework's power and extensibility.
