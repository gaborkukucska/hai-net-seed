## 🎯 Vision

HAI-Net creates a **decentralized, privacy-first framework** for human-AI collaboration that strengthens real-world communities while providing sustainable alternatives to centralized AI systems.

## 🏛️ Constitutional Foundation

HAI-Net is built on **four immutable constitutional principles**:

1. **🔒 Privacy First** - No personal data leaves Local Hub without explicit consent
2. **👥 Human Rights Protection** - AI serves humanity with accessibility and user control
3. **🌐 Decentralization** - No central authority, local autonomy, fork-resistant
4. **🤝 Community Focus** - Strengthen real-world connections and collaboration

*Every line of code enforces these principles.* [Read the Full Constitution →](./CONSTITUTION.md)

- **Testing**: pytest with constitutional compliance verification
- **Architecture**: Modular design, type safety, audit trails

## 📖 Quick Start

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.9+
- Git

### **Installation**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gaborkukucska/hai-net-seed.git
cd hai-net-seed

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run constitutional compliance tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Test core systems
python core/identity/did.py
python core/config/config_manager.py
python core/logging/logger.py
```

### **Create Your First Identity**
```python
from core.identity.did import IdentityManager

# Create constitutionally compliant identity
manager = IdentityManager()
identity = manager.create_identity(
    full_name="Your Name",
    date_of_birth="1990-01-01", 
    government_id="ID123456",
    passphrase="secure_passphrase_123",
    email="you@example.com"
)

print(f"Your HAI-Net DID: {identity['did']}")
```

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap

### **📍 Current: Phase 0 - Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**
- ✅ **Week 1**: Core infrastructure, identity, config, logging *(COMPLETE)*
- 🔄 **Week 2**: Networking (mDNS, P2P, encryption) *(IN PROGRESS)*
- 📋 **Week 3**: AI foundation (LLM integration, agent state machine)
- 📋 **Week 4**: UI foundation (FastAPI, WebGPU, React scaffold)

### **🎯 Next: Phase 1 - MVP (Weeks 5-8)**
- **Weeks 5-6**: Agent hierarchy system, Constitutional Guardian
- **Weeks 7-8**: WebGPU visualization, 4-page UI, Docker deployment

### **🚀 Future Phases**
- **Phase 2**: Alpha with mesh networking, voice services
- **Phase 3**: Beta with full AI service stack, community features  
- **Phase 4**: Production release with global network capability

## 🧠 Constitutional AI Agents

HAI-Net implements a **three-tier agent hierarchy**:

```
👑 Admin Agents    - User-linked AI entities with full control
👔 Manager Agents  - Task coordinators spawned by admin
⚙️ Worker Agents   - Specialized executors for specific tasks
🛡️ Guardian Agent  - Independent constitutional compliance monitor
```

**Agent States**: `Idle` → `Startup` → `Planning` → `Conversation` → `Work` → `Maintenance`

*All agents operate under constitutional constraints with audit trails.*

## 🌐 Network Architecture

### **Three-Layer System**
```
📱 Application Layer  - HAI-Net UI, AI Agents, User Tools
🔧 Service Layer      - AI Services, Resource Management, APIs  
🏗️ Infrastructure     - Mesh Network, Storage, Compute Pool
```

### **Resource Model**
- **🏠 Local Resources**: 100% dedicated to Local Hub users (never shared)
- **♻️ Surplus Resources**: Voluntary community sharing of idle compute
- **🌍 Environmental Focus**: Efficient resource use reduces global waste

## 🤝 Community & Governance

### **Decentralized Governance**
- **Consensus-based decisions** for technical changes
- **Community-driven development** with constitutional compliance
- **Fork-resistant architecture** prevents centralization
- **Educational approach** to violations (not punitive)

### **Real-World Community Focus**
- **In-person interaction priority** over digital-only connections
- **Local event promotion** and coordination
- **Skill sharing** and collaboration tools
- **Mutual aid** and community support systems

## 🔬 Testing & Compliance

**Constitutional Compliance Testing**:
```bash
# Run full constitutional compliance test suite
python tests/test_constitutional_compliance.py

# Expected output:
✅ Privacy First Principle: Verified
✅ Human Rights Protection: Verified  
✅ Decentralization Imperative: Verified
✅ Community Focus Principle: Verified
🎉 HAI-Net is Constitutionally Compliant!
```

**Test Coverage**:
- Privacy protection verification
- Human rights compliance checks
- Decentralization requirement testing  
- Community focus validation
- Constitutional violation detection
