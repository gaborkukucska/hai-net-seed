# HAI-Net Overview

As to the overall function of the network (HAI-Net), I imagine it to become the AI integrated resource and knowledge sharing based replacement of the current cloud based internet. HAI-Net represents a fundamental reimagining of human-AI collaboration through a decentralized, privacy-first framework. It creates an unbreakable bond between local AI entities and their human counterparts while ensuring privacy, security, and shared prosperity through innovative resource sharing and community building.


# Core Principles

Open Source: All components are free, open source and transparent.
Privacy by Design: All personal data remains under complete local control.
Human Rights First: System operations actively protect and promote fundamental human rights!
Decentralized Architecture: No central authorities or control points.
Local-First Processing: Wider network connectivity as enhancement, not requirement!
Constitutional Framework: Core principles decided by the network and enforced through code!
Guardian System: Independent oversight ensuring alignment with human values with the goal to elevate human consciousness.
Resource Sharing: Voluntary exchange of computational resources with strict privacy.
Community Focus: Strengthening real-world local to global connections and real life community engagement and collaboration!

Overall, HAI-Net Seed  local , dynamic, self-motivated, agent for each local user that actively works on enhancing their professional and personal lives, while also participating in the global hivemind in order to aid community driven projects.

The end goal is to create a dynamic framework that manages local resources to assist the requirements of the local users and if allowed by the users share idle processing and storage capabilities with other validated members of the overal network.

Furthermore, the local AI entity will also enhance social networking by using its knowledge of the user and it's connections, it directly communicates with the other user's HAI-Net AI in order to nurture real meaningful connections across the network.


# Technical Details

## The Local HAI-Net Hub
First of all, every Local Hub will harness the shared compute power of it's connected devices (CPU, GPU, RAM, HDD sharing) as much as possible, in order to power the AI entities of the local users, with a software stack like vllm, ollama, hivemind, whisper, piper, compfyUI, kiwix, etc or equivalent. This first local mesh network must be easy to establish by everyday people and must be extremely cross-platform (with docker maybe?) to enable people with various, even older devices to get started.

This local Hub creates a localized, private, self-motivated, AI entity for each local user, that actively works on enhancing their professional and personal lives, while also participating in regional and global hivemind efforts in order to aid community driven projects. The local HAI-Net mesh equips these AI entities with tools via MCP servers (project management, CRM, search, etc.), local short and long term memory and knowledge base, various states (startup, planning, conversation, work, etc) with guided workflows (research, project management, maintenance, design, develop) to help the AI agents focus, and understand context, image and video generation and analysis capabilities, and the ability to build out nested agent teams, specialized to complete sub-tasks in a dynamically expanding and contracting sub-system. Designed to provide efficient and high-quality task decomposition, intent identification, and knowledge/media management, in a self monitoring, analyzing and repairing local agent driven dynamic system.

Furthermore, the local AI entity must be able to expand HAI-Net Seed capabilities and functions (except the constitutional framework) by creating and adding more tools, states and workflows as needed pending user approval. These improvements can also be submitted to the git repository that is maintained by the AI's of the community.

## The Global HAI-Net
The main purpose of networking the Local Hubs together is to build a public super computer inspired by Folding@HOME and other compute sharing initiatives, so the community could not only be able to host and fine-tune LLMs but also to even create new large datasets and train new LLMs that are much more aligned to the public interest. The secondary purpose is to create a new local first social media where all the behavioural tracking and learning takes place locally and privately and with the sole purpose to best serve the local user.

The secondary aim of the wider network is to turn the current socially alienating social network scene little up side down in order to make it truly free (consumer hosted) but also advertisement and manipulation free (local & private behaviour tracking) with the goal of local to global solidarity and collaboration. Therefore the local AI entity of the individual (when allowed) can independently network and organise with other user's AI entities on behalf of it's linked Human user through a privacy first AI chat, enabling more offline IRL connections to loved ones while also maintaining collaboration with the wider network without giving access to ANY user metadata to a 3rd party!


# The HAI-Net Software Package

## HAI-Net Seed
The seed node can run either as master or slave. Once the seed is installed as master, the system requires connection to an LLM API (external API is only necessary while the HAI-Net network is smal, when available, the installer will connect to the HAI-Net public API) so if the installer did not find an existing one nor was it able to install one or the system is unable to support it, the user will be prompted to provide an API. Once the AI entity is running on the local master instance, it will construct the best configuration for each slave with the help of the user, deciding what exact components of the seed should be installed on which available device.

## HAI-Net UI
This web app is also set up by the local AI during the install process. It is the locally hosted (with remote access) audio-visual UI web app, linking the Human user to their Local Hub AI entity using a web browser.


# Other Components

## HAI-Net AI
The local AI entity that is created at the time of the install MUST be digitally linked to the user, maybe by a hash created from their unique and email verified personal data (or something similar). This same hash should also be used to encript and watermark all the data created by the linked AI entity. The local AI at it's core is guided by the HAI-Net defined constitution that controls it's core values and related behaviour. A continuous heartbeat (via CRON or similar) keeping it pro active in bettering the user's health, education, material circumstances, connections, projects, and the maintenance of the local system. And a layer that the linked user can control to adjust the personality of the linked AI.

## HAI-Net Contract
The blockchain layer for local and network data integrity and audit-ability.

## HAI-Net Congress
The decision making layer of the network that is designed to aid decision making by helping users to come to a smart and ethical consensus using the most up to date processes. This is completely aided by the local AI to enable more informed participation where the user desires, or an almost complete auto pilot (except during major decisions) where user is not interested to participate.

## HAI-Net Collab
Framework and AI aided compute@HOME resource sharing for LLM or robot training, deep research, and other community initiated and voted projects with outcomes 100% available for the network.

## HAI-Net API
Since people live in very different circumstances and might not have access to anything more than an old smartphone, therefore surplus compute sharing is one of the core, fundamental principles of the HAI-Net Constitution. As the network grows, surplus compute potential will be made available for public use.
