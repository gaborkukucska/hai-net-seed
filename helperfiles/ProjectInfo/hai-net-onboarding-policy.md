      - Active AI entity engagement
      - Positive contribution score
```

## Minimum Resource Sharing Policy

### Core Philosophy
```yaml
principles:
  environmental:
    - "Every idle resource is wasted energy"
    - "Shared compute reduces global carbon footprint"
    - "Collective efficiency over individual hoarding"
    
  community:
    - "From each according to ability, to each according to need"
    - "Today's contributor is tomorrow's beneficiary"
    - "Network strength comes from participation"
    
  practical:
    - "Connect everything you have"
    - "Share what you don't actively use"
    - "Grow toward self-sustainability"
```
