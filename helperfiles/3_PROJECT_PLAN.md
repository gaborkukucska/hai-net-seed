# Project Plan: HAI-Net Seed

**Version:** 0.02  
**Date:** 2025-09-29  
**Status:** Phase 1 MVP Development

## Project Overview

HAI-Net (Human-AI Network) is a decentralized, privacy-first framework for human-AI collaboration built on constitutional principles. The system creates a sustainable, community-driven alternative to centralized AI systems through a three-layer architecture supporting mesh networking, constitutional governance, and resource sharing.

## Constitutional Foundation

### Core Principles (Immutable)
1. **Privacy First**: No personal data leaves Local Hub without explicit consent
2. **Human Rights**: Protect and promote fundamental human rights
3. **Decentralization**: No central control points or single points of failure
4. **Community Focus**: Strengthen real-world connections and collaboration

### Enforcement Mechanisms
- Constitutional Guardian agent monitoring all activities
- Code-level enforcement of principles
- Educational approach to violations
- Multi-signature governance for changes

### Phase 1: Core Workflow Implementation (In Progress)

**Status:** 🟡 In Progress
**Objective:** Implement and test the core, automated, event-driven agent workflow.

#### Completed Tasks:
- [x] **✅ ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTED**: Implemented the full, event-driven agent workflow based on the TrippleEffect architecture.
- [x] **✅ AUTOMATED HIERARCHY**: The Admin -> PM -> Worker delegation chain is now fully automated.
  - An Admin creating a `<plan>` automatically creates a PM agent.
  - A PM in `startup` state creates a `<task_list>`.
  - A PM in `build_team_tasks` state can request worker creation.
- [x] **✅ STATE MACHINE FUNCTIONAL**: The agent state machine (`PLANNING`, `STARTUP`, `BUILD_TEAM_TASKS`, `ACTIVATE_WORKERS`, `WORK`) is functional and drives the workflow.
- [x] **✅ EVENT LOOP FUNCTIONAL**: The `AgentCycleHandler` correctly processes events (`plan_created`, `task_list_created`, `create_worker_requested`) to trigger workflows.
- [x] **✅ COMMUNICATION ENABLED**: The `SendMessageTool` is implemented, allowing for delegation from PM to Worker agents.
- [x] **✅ END-TO-END TEST CREATED**: A new integration test (`tests/test_automated_workflow.py`) has been created to validate the entire automated workflow.
- [x] **✅ BUILD FIX**: Corrected a critical error in the frontend build process by renaming `web/templates` to `web/public`.

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:** 🎯 **In Progress**
- [x] ✅ **ARCHITECTED**: The core TrippleEffect agent hierarchy is functional.
- [x] ✅ **DELEGATION WORKS**: The automated delegation from Admin to PM to Worker is implemented.
- [x] ✅ **TESTED**: The core automated workflow is validated with a new integration test.
- [ ] 🟡 **STABLE**: The local hub starts, but full stability requires fixing the frontend build and integration.
- [ ] 🟡 **UI FUNCTIONAL**: The UI is not yet integrated with the backend agent system.

### Phase 2: System Integration & Feature Enhancement (Planned)
