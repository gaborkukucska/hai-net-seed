# Project Plan: HAI-Net Seed

**Version:** 0.02  
**Date:** 2025-09-29  
**Status:** Phase 1 MVP Development

## Project Overview

HAI-Net (Human-AI Network) is a decentralized, privacy-first framework for human-AI collaboration built on constitutional principles. The system creates a sustainable, community-driven alternative to centralized AI systems through a three-layer architecture supporting mesh networking, constitutional governance, and resource sharing.

## Constitutional Foundation

### Core Principles (Immutable)
1. **Privacy First**: No personal data leaves Local Hub without explicit consent
2. **Human Rights**: Protect and promote fundamental human rights
3. **Decentralization**: No central control points or single points of failure
4. **Community Focus**: Strengthen real-world connections and collaboration

### Enforcement Mechanisms
- Constitutional Guardian agent monitoring all activities
- Code-level enforcement of principles
- Educational approach to violations
- Multi-signature governance for changes
